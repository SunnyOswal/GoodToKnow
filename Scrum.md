+ **Scrum**  
is a framework used by teams to **manage their work**.

+ **Scrum Lifecycyle**  
Scrum is iterative. The entire lifecycle is completed in fixed time-period called a **Sprint**.
  + A Sprint is typically 2-4 weeks long.  

+ **Scrum Roles**  
    + **Product Owner**:  
        + Responsible for **what** the team is building, and **why** they’re building it.  
        + Responsible for keeping the **backlog up-to-date** and in **priority order**.
    
    + **Scrum Master**:  
        + Responsible to ensure the scrum process is followed by the team.      
        + Continually on the lookout for how the team can improve, while also resolving impediments (blocking issues) that arise during the sprint.  
        + Part coach, part team member, and part cheerleader.  
            
    + **Scrum Team**:
        + Idividuals that actually build the product.
        + Team owns the engineering of the product, and the quality that goes with it.
        
+ **Product Backlog**  
is a prioritized list of value the team can deliver.  
    + The Product Owner owns the backlog and adds, changes, and reprioritizes as needed.
    + The items at the top of the backlog should always be ready for the team to execute on.
    
+ **Sprint Planning**  
the team **chooses the backlog items they will work on** in the upcoming sprint based on priority and what they believe they can complete in the sprint.  

+ **Sprint Backlog**  
**list of items** the team plans to deliver in the sprint. Often, each item on the Sprint Backlog is broken down into tasks. Once all members agree the Sprint Backlog is achievable, the Sprint starts .

+ **Sprint Execution**  
Once the Sprint starts, the team executes on the Sprint Backlog.  

+ **Daily Scrum**  
daily meeting limited to 15 minutes. Team members often stand during the meeting, to ensure it stays brief. Each team member briefly **reports their progress** since yesterday, the plans for today, and anything impeding their progress.
    
    + **Task Board**:  
        + Lists each backlog item the team is working on, broken down into the tasks required to complete it.
        + Tasks are placed in To Do, In Progress, and Done columns based on their status.
        + It provides a visual way of tracking progress for each backlog item.
    + **Sprint Burndown**:
        + A graph that plots the **daily total of remaining work**. Remaining work is typically in hours.
        + It provides a visual way of showing **whether the team is “on track” to complete all the work** by the end of the Sprint.
  
+ **Sprint Review**  
team demonstrates what they’ve accomplished to stakeholders. They demo the software and show its value.

+ **Sprint Retrospective**  
team takes time to reflect on what went well and which areas need improvement. The outcome of the retrospective are actions for next sprint.

+ **Increment**  
is the product of a Sprint or “Potentially Shippable Increment”.
    + Sprint’s output should be of shippable quality, even if it’s part of something bigger and can’t ship by itself. 
    + It should meet all the quality criteria set by the team and Product Owner.
