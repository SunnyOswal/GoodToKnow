+ DevOps is a cultural and professional movement while automating the end-to-end process of software development.

+ In today's highly disruptive business environment organizations need both rapid responsiveness to change in the form of frequent releases and stability in the form of quality deployments.
+ DevOps in the correct context which is about communication / collaboration between the Dev and the Ops teams.
+ IT must understand the organization's purpose, cause and belief so that they can align themselves with the organization's vision to avoid silo culture.

+ Since the organization is facing both 'delay' and 'quality' issues the BEST approach is to balance the release frequency and quality of each release.
+ Bi-modal IT is a concept where two distinct IT methodologies exist in the same company. For example Agile development teams and Waterfall development teams working in the same business unit.
+ Kanban is a FLOW based method which enables PULL system at a sustainable pace. The Japanese term Kanban means 'cards you can see'.

+ Agile methodologies can be used in projects where the future direction of the project should be determined based on frequent releases and it's feedback.

+ DevOps helps in reducing the failure rate of new releases. This is achieved through collaboration of different teams, continuous integration, continuous delivery, etc.
+ In high performing organizations 'trust' plays a vital role. Culture is the first step in DevOps transformation. Then comes tools, processes and automation.

+ **3 principles of DevOps**
  + First way : Value Stream Mapping (FLOW from left to right).
  + Second way : Insists on amplifying short feedback loops from right to left.

  + **IT** :
    + Increased Test Coverage
    + Reduced Time to deploy
    + Reduced defect cycle time. (MTTR)
    + Deployment frequency

**MISCONCEPTIONS**
+ ISO is not involved in the subject of DevOps.
+ DevOps is NOT a set of best practices. It is a cultural movement based on collaboration, automation, Lean, Agile, etc.
+ DevOps is NOT a one size fits all strategy. For every DevOps implementation the strategy needs to be defined based on the organization's vision and goals (WHY).
+ The purpose of NewOps is NOT to remove the need of human competencies. But to use the human competencies for better decision making, creating more automation, client interactions, etc.
