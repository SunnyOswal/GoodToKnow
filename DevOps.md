+ Bi-modal IT is a concept where two distinct IT methodologies exist in the same company. For example Agile development teams and Waterfall development teams working in the same business unit.
+ Both 'Deployment Frequency' and 'Mean Time To Recover (MTTR)' helps in demonstrating the IT benefits of DevOps. Other metrics are Deployment Time and Deployment Success Rate.
+ Kanban is a FLOW based method which enables PULL system at a sustainable pace. The Japanese term Kanban means 'cards you can see'.
