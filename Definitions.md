+ Default Gateway/ Router  
The router provides a way for local subnet traffic to exit their subnet and travel to another network as their final destination.

+ DHCP servers  
Provide IP addresses to clients for a set lease time

+ DNS servers  
Resolve domain names to IP addresses, and WINS servers map computer NetBIOS names to IP addresses

+ IP Packets  
Contain source and destination IP addresses

+ SOCKET  
Combination of the IP address, Protocol (TCP or UDP) and the Port number forms a socket at both the receiving and sending hosts. Since each socket is unique, an application can send and receive data to and from multiple hosts. 

+ Tracert  
Traces the route a packet takes from the source to destination
